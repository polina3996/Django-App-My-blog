# Django-App-My-blog-
It's an application that stores all the stories written by registered users, that became authors with the help of this app.

You can visit the app without registration, but you can't read the story or leave your story. 

Once registered and logged in, you can use the app as you want: write your own story, read another story, see your profile and edit it, edit or delete your story(only if superuser gave you this permission). Tags and categories will help you while using the app.

All users and stories are stored in a database (based on SQLite3).

Start

(in Terminal):
~cd my_blog
~python manage.py runserver
